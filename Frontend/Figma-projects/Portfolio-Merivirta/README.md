## Portfolio - Merivirta Visuals

- This is my own project.
- I created a website for myself called Merivirta Visuals. The purpose of the project was to create a simple website where clients could find the necessary information. I occasionally do photography gigs, so I decided to design a visual look for the website using Figma.
