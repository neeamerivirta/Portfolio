## Niitty2 -project

- Niitty2 -project project was implemented at school. The Niitty2 project team hoped to give their website a new visual identity. The purpose of the work was to design a new look for the website and to solve how the material would be made available to the user.
- The project's pages were not user-friendly, and all the material was a bit jumbled on the pages.
- The project was carried out as a pair work. In this project, I designed the mobile version of my pages, and my partner implemented the layout of the website. The project was planned in Figma.
