# Portfolio - Neea Merivirta

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here you'll find a collection of diverse coding projects covering a wide range of topics and technologies. The repository includes projects in different programming languages, web development and much more. Explore the various projects and find inspiration, learn new skills, and discover my expertise!

## Project folders

- Frontend: React, Figma-works, WWW-techniques, css, scss...
- Backend: Java, Python, Node.js...
- Fullstack: Node.js, JSON, MySQL, React...

## Features

- Project stands out due to its innovative approach to language learning. Unlike traditional language learning platforms, we have implemented a personalized learning experience that adapts to the user's progress. Our 'Learn English Words' module not only tests users on vocabulary but also provides real-time feedback, allowing them to understand and correct their mistakes immediately.

- In addition, the backend architecture is designed for scalability and efficiency. A MySQL database and an Express.js server are used to store and retrieve word pairs, which ensures optimal performance even as the user base grows. The use of RESTful API endpoints increases the flexibility of the application.

- In addition, the user interface is designed to be as clear as possible, which promotes the learning experience. I have also taken into account the responsive user experience, where the application is available on different devices.
